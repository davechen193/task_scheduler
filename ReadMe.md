Do you know anyone that has a huge congestion on their todo list?
Here comes the solution with Task Scheduler!

Basically, the scheduler treats the scheduling like building a sturdy brick wall with constraints at the right hand side (due date constraint)

Assume that we are given some tasks with due dates. To avoid overdue tasks,
the scheduler does not schedule tasks past their due dates and tend to add
onto schedules to the right to make less congestion for each single day.

How to use? Well, it's easy, just submit a few of tasks like the following:

prepare meeting,3,7

Supposedly, hero has a meeting that needs to be attend to within the next 7 days for
3 times; he promptly entered the below tasks:

prepare meeting,3,7

prepare class,1,7


By using the Task Scheduler, we get something like this:

wednesday_12/22 ['prepare meeting']

thursday_12/23 ['prepare meeting']

friday_12/24 ['prepare meeting']

saturday_12/25 ['prepare class']


Voila! Now we can begin to clear our todo list by planning out the tasks for each day. Very convenient right?
